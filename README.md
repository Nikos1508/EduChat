# Educhat

Educhat is an application for schools. Here, students can talk with other students from their school and also get updated on upcoming events on the calendar screen and for the program via the timetable screen. 

It's the first project for me where I am working with the backend and databases, so there are many features working in the Supabase tables, like image uploading (in alpha state), password reset (hidden for now), email confirmation, auto-login, and many other functionalities yet to come.

To install it, you just have to download this (https://github.com/Nikos1508/EduChat/blob/main/app/release/app-release.apk) APK file on your phone or tablet and sign up. The app is available in English and Greek (and, soon, in French, too).

For now, everyone has the same credentials and the right to do the same things, but in an upcoming update, I will add some code so each person has different rights on the app (delete channels, create channels, ban people, post events, join special channels, etc.)
